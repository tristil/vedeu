  # ModelNotFound: Raised with Vedeu attempts to access a named model that does

  # InvalidSyntax: Raised when Vedeu attempts to parse a {Vedeu.view} or
  #   {Vedeu.interface} and encounters a problem.
  #
  # MissingRequired: Raised when a name is not provided for a model when
  #   attempting to store it in a repository.
  #
  # ModeSwitch: Raised intentionally when the client application wishes to
  #   switch between cooked and raw (or vice versa) terminal modes. Vedeu is

  # OutOfRange: Raised when trying to access an interface column less than 1 or
  #   greater than 12. Vedeu is hard-wired to a 12-column layout for the time
  #   being.
